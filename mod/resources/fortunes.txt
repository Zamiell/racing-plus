go fast

why are you
min-maxing in a
speedrun?

you must be really
desperate for
soul hearts

hoping for a
broken remote?

it is only a 3.32%
chance to get a
crystal ball

a curved horn
would be nice

i bet you would
like some cancer
right now

the timer is
ticking

tick tock

wasting precious
seconds

this is a message
that is wasting
your time

useless messages
in speedruns sure
are great

racing+ is the
best mod ever
created

you'll never be
as handsome
as zamiel

pro tip: this
is not the way
to be #1

is doing this
really worth it?

use cards and
pills to cancel
animations

always submit
bug reports
via discord

make bomb hearts
to inflame your
opponents

you'll pb one day

skill is equal to
time invested -
keep practicing

looking for an
emperor?

afterbirth+ is
the best dlc
to speedrun

Is there a single person here who still
believes dea1h is legit? This is the Nth
time he wrecks a WR on his first
attempt and he always does so getting
<1 min of resets on every character into
big 4 starts he's done that on EVERY
cathegory. Does anyone still believe
that guy is not cheating in some way?
