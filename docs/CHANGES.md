## Introduction

Overall, the main point of the Racing+ mod is to enable multiplayer racing with other people. You will find that doing a speedrun using the Racing+ mod will be very similar to doing a speedrun on the vanilla game.

With that said, Racing+ does make a lot of smaller changes that you might not be able to pick-up on right away. This page documents every change that it performs.

Most changes are prefixed by a code, like: `001`. This signifies that the change can be toggled on and off using the [Mod Config Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818&searchtext=modconfigmenu). If a change does not have a prefix, you won't be able to toggle that option, since it is accomplished by modifying the game's resource files directly.

<br />

## Design Goals

In terms of what to change about the game, the mod has several goals, and attempts to strike a balance between them. However, certain things are prioritized. The goals are listed below in order of importance:

1. to reward skillful play (in the context of speedrunning and racing)
1. to make the game more fun to play
1. to fix bugs and imperfections
1. to keep the game as "vanilla" as possible

<br />

## List of Major Changes

### 1) The D6 for Everyone

`001` All characters now start with the D6, either as a pocket item or an active item.

> Why? Much of the strategy in the game is centered around having this item. The best players win races more consistently when having the D6 because it mitigates run disparity.

### 2) No Curses

`002` All curses are automatically disabled.

> Why? Curses make the game less-skilled based, robbing the player of meaningful decision-making and strategy.

### 3) Devil Room & Angel Room Rebalancing

- Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms have been [customized](changes-room.md#devil--angel-room-rebalancing) for the purposes of slightly increasing the average number of items per room. Specifically:
  - Average items per devil room are increased from [TODO] to [TODO].
  - Average items per angel room are increased from [TODO] to [TODO].

> Why? The best players separate themselves from the mid-tier players by not taking any damage and getting every Devil Room / Angel Room. If the rewards from these rooms are not consistent enough, then the best players are not able to consistently win races.

- `003` On Basement 2, players receive a Your Soul trinket upon entering a Devil Room if they have not yet taken damage during the run.
  - Keeper and Tainted Keeper will be awarded 15 cents instead of a Your Soul trinket.

> Why? Some characters do not start with enough health to take the first devil deal, which is an important reward for playing perfectly. Instead of buffing the health of some characters, it is simpler to give every character one free devil deal (provided that they play flawlessly for the first two floors).

### 4) Fast-Reset

`004` The restart/reset key immediately restarts the game, as long as you have not entered more than 3 rooms.

> Why? In vanilla, the game enforces a 2 second limit between resets, but there is no good reason for this. Speeding this up makes resetting for a starting item less tedious.

### 5) Fast-Clear

- `005` Rooms are considered cleared at the beginning of an enemy's death animation, rather than the end.

> Why? It is obnoxious to have to sit and wait for a long death animation to finish before being able to proceed with the game. The game was never originally intended to have this behavior, as demonstrated by Wrath of the Lamb.

### 6) Fast-Travel

- `006` The long fade-in and fade-out between floors is replaced with a custom animation where you jump out of a hole.
- `006` The long fade-in and fade-out between crawlspaces is replaced with the normal room transition animation.

### 7) Room Fixes

Rooms with unavoidable damage or bugs have been fixed or deleted. The technical specifics are listed in a [separate page](changes-room.md).

### 8) Room Flipping

While there are thousands of rooms in the game, many players have already seen them all. To increase run variety, all rooms have a chance to be flipped on the X axis, Y axis, or both axes.

<!--

Post-flip actions:

1) Remove the duplicated start rooms for The Chest / Dark Room

2) Un-flip Y-flipped Gurdy rooms:
   The Chest - #20015, #30015

3) Un-flip double Gate rooms (and enable all of the doors)
   The Chest - #20040, #30040
   Dark Room - #20012, #30012

4) Un-flip some Mega Maw rooms:
   The Chest - #20039, #30039, #20059, #30059, #20121, #30121
   Dark Room - #20011, #30011

-->

<br />

## List of Minor Changes

### 1) Custom Hotkeys

- Racing+ allows you to bind some optional hotkeys via Mod Config Menu:
  - a fast-drop button (for everything)
  - a fast-drop button for only trinkets
  - a fast-drop button for only pocket items

### 2) Character Changes

- `021` Judas starts with a bomb.

> Why? Historically, Isaac was the main character used in tournaments. After Balls of Steel 4, tournaments started using Judas as the main character instead, since he had a higher damage multiplier. At this time, it was desirable for Judas to have a bomb so that he would play in a similar way to Isaac. Starting with a bomb makes the game slightly more skill-based, since it gives players the option to bomb a tinted rock, escape a slow 2x2 room, and so forth.

- `022` Samson's Child's Heart is automatically dropped.

>  Why? When playing as Samson, players usually immediately drop the Child's Heart to improve their odds at good room drops.

- `023` Tainted Keeper starts with 15 cents.

> Why? This gives Tainted Keeper enough money to start a Treasure Room item, which is considered to be important for unseeded speedruns.

- `024` Eden's starting items will be shown in the starting room.

> Why? Many speedrunners do not use the in-game item tracker, since it clutters the screen. This feature allows players to quickly see what the Eden items are, allowing them to reset the game if the items are bad.

### 3) Boss Changes

- `031` Bosses will be faded during their death animation.

> Why? Bosses with long death animations obscure the identity of the item that drops, forcing players to wait for the death animation to complete before being able to take or roll the item. Furthermore, the death animation obscures other enemies that happen to be behind the dying boss.

- `032` Stop Death from performing his slow attack.
- `033` The unnecessary waiting during the Haunt fight is removed.
- `034` The unnecessary waiting during the Satan fight is removed.

> Why? It doesn't make sense that Death's slow effect can persist on the player even after Death has been defeated.

- `035` Big Horn will spend less time underground.

> Why? Big Horn can take a long time to attack, resulting in the player being forced to wait without performing any inputs.

- `036` The Lamb body is removed upon death.

> Why? It can interfere with touching a trophy / chest.

- `037` The Victory Lap popup will no longer appear after defeating The Lamb.

> Why? Speedrunners never want to do a Victory Lap; they just want to finish the run.

- Some of the animations in the Mega Satan fight have been removed.

> Why? Several parts of the Mega Satan fight force the player to wait without performing any inputs.

- Hush no longer plays an appear animation.

> Why? The animation is very long, resulting in the player being forced to wait without performing any inputs.

- Defeating Mega Satan no longer has a chance to immediately end the run.

> Why? This gives players a chance to touch a trophy, use a Fool card, etc.

- Defeating The Beast no longer immediately ends the run.

> Why? This gives players a chance to touch a trophy.

### 4) Enemy Changes

- `041` Cod Worms are replaced with Para-Bites.

> Why? Cod Worms force the player to sit and wait without performing any inputs. This is terrible game design and not conducive to competitive play.

- `042` Wizoobs, Red Ghosts, and Lil' Haunts no longer have invulnerability frames after spawning.

> Why? No other enemies in the game are invulnerable during this time, so this mechanic doesn't make any sense. It results in the player being forced to wait without performing any inputs.

- `043` Wizoobs and Red Ghosts have faster attack patterns.

> Why? These enemies can take a long time to attack, resulting in the player being forced to wait without performing any inputs.

- `044` Mom's Hands and Mom's Dead Hands have faster attack patterns.

> Why? These enemies can take a long time to attack, resulting in the player being forced to wait without performing any inputs.

- `045` Mom's Hands and Mom's Dead Hands will play an "Appear" animation.

> Why? This gives deaf players a visual tell that they will need to dodge the hands. (Normally, this is signaled with a loud, obnoxious laugh from Mom.)

- `046` Globins will permanently die on the 4th regeneration to prevent softlocks.

> Why? Having Epic Fetus and Polyphemus make it impossible to kill Globins fast enough before they regenerate.

### 5) Quality of Life Changes

- Players will start in the center of the room (instead of at the bottom).

> Why? This is convenient because it makes the player equidistant to all of the doors.

- `051` The fade in at the beginning of a run is sped-up.
- `052` First floor Treasure Rooms are slightly changed so that you never have to spend a bomb or walk on spikes.

> Why? This slightly decreases the time spent in the resetting phase, which everyone agrees is not very fun.

- `053` Enemy red creep is changed to green and friendly green creep is changed to red.

> Why? So that player creep will never be mistaken for enemy creep and vice versa. Furthermore, it is very difficult to see red enemy creep on the Womb floors.

- `054` The disruptive teleport from entering a room with Gurdy, Mom, Mom's Heart, or It Lives! no longer occurs.
- `055` Void portals that spawn after bosses are automatically deleted.

> Why? With very few exceptions, racers and speedrunners will never go to The Void. The random Void portals that spawn can be accidentally jumped into, ruining the current run.

- `056` The number of sacrifices will be shown in the top-left when in a Sacrifice Room.
- `057` If you have Dream Catcher, the Treasure Room item and the boss will be shown in the starting room.

> Why? Since the Fast-Travel feature removes the floor transition cutscene, this is the only way to see what the Dream Catcher items are.

- `058` The tears that explode out of enemies when you have Vasculitis are faded.

> Why? It can be very difficult to distinguish between friendly Vasculitis tears and enemy tears, since they will often be the same color.

- `059` Identified pills will be shown when the player presses the map button (tab). (Only up to 7 will be shown.)
- `060` An icon will be shown on the UI when the player has reached the maximum amount of familiars (i.e. 64).
- `061` The Hush door will be automatically opened.
- `062` Fortune Cookie text is removed.

### 6) Gameplay Changes

- Mercurius is removed.

> Why? This item has a nasty combination of being incredibly powerful and not very skill-based. Having Mercurius in the game helps worse players win races more often.

- The Karma trinket is removed.

> Why? Since all Donation Machines are removed, it has no effect.

- The Amnesia and ??? pills are removed.

> Why? Since curses are automatically removed, these pills have no effect.

### 7) Cutscenes & Animations

- The intro that occurs when you launch the game is removed.
- The cutscenes that occur when finishing a run are removed.
- The cutscenes that occur before each boss are removed.
- All "giantbook" animations are removed (with the exception of Book of Revelations, Satanic Bible, eternal hearts, and rainbow poop).
- `071` Teleport animations are sped up by a factor of 2.
- The pause and unpause animations are removed.

### 8) Bug Fixes

- `081` All forms of teleport will no longer send you to an invalid entrance.
- Restock Machines will now appear in shops 25% of the time.

> Why? According to the patch notes, this is the way that vanilla is supposed to be, but they messed up and no Restock Machines will ever appear.

- Having Duality will now always give you both the Devil Room and the Angel Room.

> Why? This does not happen consistently on vanilla like you would expect. Many boss rooms that only have 2 possible doors have been adjusted to have 3 doors.

- Entering a Black Market will no longer send you to the I AM ERROR room.

> Why? In v820, all Black Markets became broken in this way.

- Returning from a crawlspace in a Boss Rush or Devil Deal will no longer send you to the wrong room. (This is part of Fast-Travel.)
- The trapdoor / beam of light in I AM ERROR rooms will no longer be accessible if the room is not cleared. (This is part of Fast-Travel.)


### 9) Graphics Fixes

- `091` The Distant Admiration, Forever Alone, and Friend Zone sprites now match the color of the actual familiars.
- `092` The 20/20 sprite is now easier to see.
- `093` The Star of Bethlehem sprite is now more distinct from Eden's Soul. (Credit goes to [Chebupeli](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198370261026).) <!-- cspell:disable-line -->
- The Locust of Famine sprite now matches the color of the flies.
- The Error trinket sprite now has an outline. (Credit goes to [O_o](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993627005).)
- `094` Paschal Candle now visually "fills up" so that you can easily tell at a glance if it is maxed out.
- Pills now have a consistent orientation regardless of whether they are on the ground or in your inventory.
- The color of some pills are changed to make them easier to identify at a glance:
  - White-dotted / Red --> Full red
  - Pink / Red --> White / Red
  - White / White-dotted --> Full white-dotted
- The colors of some Purity auras have been changed to make them easier to see. Speed is now green and range is now yellow.
- The icon for a dirty bedroom is now a cobweb so that it is more distinct from a clean bedroom.
- The controls graphic in the start room is changed to be speedrunning-themed.
- The vanilla in-game timer and score text will no longer appear. (Hold Tab to see a custom in-game timer.)

> Why? The text blocks gameplay.

- The graphics for fortunes and custom seeds are set to 15% opacity.

> Why? So that gameplay is not blocked when you use Rules card.

### 10) Sound Fixes

- `101` The audio clips of mom and dad on the Ascent are silenced.

### 11) Other

- `111` A custom console is provided that is better than the vanilla console.

> Why? The vanilla console has an annoying animation and is inconvenient to use.
