# Racing+ Diversity Races

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

## General Description

In diversity races, each racer starts with the same 5 items:

- 3 random passive items
- 1 random active item
- 1 random smelted trinket

These items are given in addition to the character's original passive items and resources. These items are hidden from the player until the race starts.

Furthermore, characters with an active item (e.g. Magdalene with the Yum Heart) are given the Schoolbag so that they can hold both their normal active item and the new diversity active item. However, this does not apply to Eden and Tainted Eden because we want to prevent players rolling their build with the D4, D100, etc. (For more information, see "Item Bans" below.)

In general, the extra power level increase from these 5 items is a fun boost at the beginning of a run. However, you don't always start with "good" items! One of the most interesting things about diversity races is that it forces players to use the items in the game that they would not normally pick up. This puts players in unique situations that they would never otherwise be in.

## Reset Time Reduction

To cut down on the reset time to get the run going, the first Treasure Room will always have 2 item pedestals. From Basement 2 onwards, the Treasure Rooms will be normal.

## Item Bans

The following items are removed from all items pools, because they override tear effects. Note that it is still possible to start with them as one of the 3 random passive items.

- 114 - Mom's Knife

The following items are also removed from all item pools, because they allow you to re-roll your build, which spoils the fun.

- 283 - D100
- 284 - D4
- 489 - D Infinity
- 622 - Genesis
- 703 - Esau Jr.
