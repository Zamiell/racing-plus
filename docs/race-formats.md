# Racing+ Race Formats

On Racing+, players have the option to choose from different kinds of races.

Regardless of the format:
- The Polaroid or The Negative will be automatically removed depending on your run goal.
- The trapdoor or the beam of light on Womb 2 will be automatically removed depending on your run goal or which photo you have (if you have the Fast-Travel feature enabled).

<br />

## Unseeded

- Historically, most races have been unseeded. This means that both players start with the same character but play on different seeds.
- Each player is allowed to reset as many times as they want. Typically, each player will reset over and over until they find a good starting item from the Basement 1 Treasure Room.

<br />

## Seeded

- In seeded races, all players play on the same seed. (This means that they should get all of the same items, bosses, and so forth.)
- Resetting is allowed, but it will just take a player back to the beginning of the same seed.
- Each player will start with a pre-defined starting item that is chosen before the match, such as Cricket's Head or Mom's Knife.
- The Basement 1 Treasure Room is removed. (This is to prevent players from starting with 2 items instead of 1.)
- All characters start with The Compass in addition to their other items (to mitigate floor RNG).
- Some additional things are guaranteed to be seeded:
  - Room drops (given in order, regardless of luck)
  - Level generation (consistent special rooms, regardless of inventory status)
  - Devil Room layouts and items (given in order)
  - Angel Room layouts and items (given in order)
- The following things no longer affect room drops:
  - Luck (always uses a value of 0 luck)
  - Rib of Greed
  - Smelter
  - Guppy's Tail
- Magic 8 Ball no longer increases the chance for a Planetarium to spawn.
- Sol is removed from all pools (since it is practically useless with the Compass).
- Glyph of Balance is removed from all pools (since it changes drop-generation).
- Damocles is removed from all pools (since it is unseeded).
- Birthright is removed from all pools if the starting character is Cain (since it changes floor-generation).
- Cain's Eye is removed from the trinket pool (since it is useless with the Compass).
- Daemon's Tail, Child's Heart, Rusted Key, Match Stick, Lucky Toe, Safety Cap, Ace of Spades, Watch Battery, and Nuh Uh! are removed from the trinket pool (since they change drop-generation).
- Silver Dollar, Bloody Crown, Telescope Lens, Holy Crown, and Wicked Crown are removed from the trinket pool (since they change floor-generation).
- There is a custom death mechanic:
  - Instead of dying, players will respawn in the previous room with 1.5 soul hearts.
  - They will have a "debuff" effect that removes all of the items. The debuff will last 45 seconds.
  - This mechanic does not apply to deaths in Devil Rooms, Sacrifice Rooms, or the Boss Rush. (Deaths in those rooms will be permanent.)
- 3 Dollar Bill is seeded per room.
- Not entering a Treasure Room no longer increases the chance of a Planetarium spawning.

<br />

## Diversity

- Diversity races are similar to unseeded races in that each player plays on different seeds and is allowed to reset as much as they want.
- However, each racer starts with the same five random items. (This is in addition to the character's original passive items and resources.)
- For additional information, see [the documentation for diversity races](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/README-DIVERSITY.md).

<br />

## Custom

- There are no additional changes to the game in this format.
- Custom allows people to race with their own custom rules. For example, you could make a race where you are not allowed to pick up any Devil Room items.
- Make sure that everyone in the race knows the rules before starting.
- This option is used for multi-character speedrun races.
