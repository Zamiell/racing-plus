- Note that this patch contains some changes for the R+7 Seeded custom challenge. You may have to redo research that was previously done.
- There is a new custom system for awarding room clear awards when playing on a set seed. This will prevent situations where one player goes the wrong way and gets an Emperor card in a seeded race, for example. It is exactly the same as the vanilla system except for the following changes:

### *v0.26.2* - November 15th, 2018

- The "level" console command will now always assume that you are in a seeded race. (Thanks thereisnofuture)

### *v0.26.0* - November 14th, 2018

- Note that this patch contains some changes for the R+7 Seeded custom challenge. You may have to redo research that was previously done.
- Normally, special room placement is affected by coin count, key count, health amount, and more. This can be a problem for seeded races, as two players can get slightly different floors. This patch contains a new custom system that is turned on in seeded races and the R+7 Seeded custom challenge to provide consistent level generation. Right before you reach the next floor, the custom system will now manually set all of the things that affect level generation in a seeded way, and then swap them back after the floor is generated. The percentages of getting the outcomes are as follows:
  - Devil Room visited: 0% on B2, 100% otherwise
  - Book touched: 50% for 0 touched, 50% for 1 touched
  - Coins: 50% for 0 coins, 50% for 20 coins
  - Keys: 50% for 0 keys, 50% for 2 keys
  - Full health: 66% for full health, 33% for damaged health
  - Critical health: 75% for non-critical health, 25% for critical health
- Because of the above system, Boss Rushes are no longer manually created in seeded races.
- Previously, rerolled items from player-created pedestals would be seeded based on the particular room. Now, they are seeded based on the start seed.
- The "level #" custom command has been added to the console. This command will take you to the particular stage and stage type for the particular seed. If you are in a seeded race or the R+7 Seeded custom challenge, it will also perform the necessary seeded swapping beforehand. Example usage: "level 5"
- Rooms will no longer be reseeded in the R+7 Seeded custom challenge (for Duality, duplicate rooms, etc.).
- Silver Dollar and Bloody Crown are now removed from seeded races and the R+7 Seeded custom challenge.
- Fixed the (vanilla) bug where Dead Sea Scrolls was not seeded.
- Fixed the bug where Teleports were not being seeded correctly under certain circumstances.
- Fixed the bug where drops from Bag-style familiars were not being seeded correctly under certain circumstances.

### *v0.25.5* - November 7th, 2018

- Frame counts will no longer show, since sliding animations will not count towards frames seen. (Thanks thereisnofuture)

### *v0.25.4* - November 6th, 2018

- When a Chub emerges from The Matriarch, all enemies in the room will now be killed (which is similar to the mechanic when Mom / It Lives! is killed).
- When completing a race or speedrun, Racing+ will now show you the number of frames that passed. This will let you know how much time you lose to lag. In tournaments, the winner of very close races should be decided by frame count.
- Fixed the bug where Epic Fetus would not work properly on Samael. (Thanks Shigan)
- Fixed the bug where the artificial Matriarch Chub stun was not working properly.

### *v0.24.7* - October 26th, 2018

### *v0.19.1* - May 10th, 2018

News:

- While the Devil Room and Angel Room changes introduced last week were seen as an improvement by most of the community, I'm not satisfied until I can make Racing+ the best it can be. Based on community feedback, there is room for some things to be tweaked. Most people were indeed in favor of reducing RNG, but a significant portion liked the "fun" aspect of getting a 4 item devil deal. So, it seems appropriate to strike a compromise between getting fun rooms and getting consistent rewards, so that everyone can get some of what they want.
- Furthermore, a good chunk of people felt like Devil Rooms needed a slight buff, as Afterbirth+ and the Booster Packs have further diluted the pool value. In the previous change, the overall power level of Devil Rooms remained the same. But adhering to this principle is restrictive in that it forces a specific amount of 1 item deals. Adding a few pedestals is a slight buff to Devil Rooms, but it also has the benefit of helping to reduce RNG. In addition to adding pedestals, I've also done some other nerfs for balance reasons.
- Angel Rooms look to be in a good spot, so hardly any changes to them seem necessary.
- The results of the "rock" poll (regarding the Treasure Room change) was 15 to 23 in favor of not changing anything. However, the vast majority of people were for making the change on Basement 1 only, so I've done the work to custom code that, and this should satisfy almost everyone.

Mod Changes:

- Devil Deals have been nerfed:
  - There are no longer any enemies in Devil Rooms, so it is harder to get your D6 up and backtracking is more important.
  - There are no longer black hearts and Red Chests in Devil Rooms.
  - It is no longer possible to get heart drops from fires in Devil Rooms.
  - There are more hazards in various Devil Rooms.
  - The 2 Red Chests in room #16 have been replaced with 4 bombs.
  - The random card in room #15 has been removed.
  - There is a 0.6% chance to get a room with 10 Red Chests. (There is a 10% chance to get an item per Red Chest, so this will yield one or more items 65% of the time.)
- Devil Deals have been buffed:
  - There is a 23.5% chance to get a room with 1 item (decreased from 31.6%).
  - There is a 70.4% chance to get a room with 2 items (increased from 68.4%).
  - There is a 5% chance to get a room with 3 items (increased from 0%).
  - There is a 0.6% chance to get a room with 4 items (increased from 0%).
  - The Red Chest in room #14 has been replaced with a ? card.
- The Angel Room with 2 items behind key blocks (#7) now has 3 items.
- You will now always be able to take an item in the Basement 1 Treasure Room without spending a bomb or being forced to walk on spikes. (Thanks Cyber_1)
- Removed the custom handling for Mushrooms, since the unavoidable damage from skulls was fixed in the vanilla game, and Edmund personally confirmed that he intended for Mushrooms to appear in floors other than 3 and 4.

- Integrated the [Unique Card Backs](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1120999933) mod by [piber20](https://steamcommunity.com/id/piber20) into Racing+, which is a quality of life / sprite improvement mod.
- Since the game's mod support is very buggy, Racing+ has always had an issue where when you enable Racing+ for the first time from the mod menu and then immediately go into a game, certain things will not be initialized properly. (For example, boss cutscenes will play during this state.) Racing+ will now detect this corrupted state and show an error message advising you to close and reopen the game.
- There will no longer be a delay before The Haunt sends out his first Lil' Haunt to attack you.
- The spawning of Key Piece 1 and Key Piece 2 are now sped up in the same way that Krampus items are.
- Fixed the bug where both photos would spawn on the season 1 speedrun challenges if you had Mysterious Paper.
- Fixed the bug where the wrong direction would appear after It Lives! or Hush if you had Mysterious Paper under certain conditions.
- Fixed the bug where the Sloth, Super Sloth, Pride, and Super Pride card seeding wasn't being applied to flipped rooms.

### *v0.10.7* - September 14th, 2017

- Fixed the bug where the client would not remember that you selected a random character. (Thanks Shigan)
- Fixed the bug where the mod was improperly deleting A Lump of Coal from Mystery Gift. (Thanks Thalen22)

### *v0.10.3* - September 13th, 2017

- Fixed the bug where Krampus' Head would get deleted under certain conditions. (Thanks leo_ze_tron)
- Fixed the bug where the new race tooltip would not show some sections on startup under certain conditions. (Thanks Shigan and Blumpkin Idaho)
- Fixed the bug where you could fight Mega Satan twice if you teleported out of the fight after killing him. (Thanks Gamonymous)

### *v0.10.0* - September 10th, 2017

Gameplay:

- Shops are no longer flipped.
- The Y-flipped double Gate rooms and double Mega Maw rooms have been unflipped due to how the patterns from their respective champion versions are much harder to dodge from behind. (Thanks Shigan)
- Krampus' item will now spawn at the beginning of the death animation rather than midway through. This prevents the Krampus item getting deleted if you accidentally leave the Devil Room as soon as the doors open. Furthermore, this means that it is now possible to do the "Anti Quick Roll" strategy in Racing+, where you can roll the item before the room is cleared to get an extra charge on the D6. (Note that unlike before, this is now a frame perfect trick.) (Thanks Thoday)
- Unfair Dople / Evil Twin tears that fire on the first frame were previously "fixed" by adjusting the Dople / Evil Twin placement in the room. However, this method did not reliably stop Evil Twin triple shots from hitting the player, so Dople / Evil Twin placement has been reverted to vanilla in all rooms and new Lua code will automatically delete any projectiles fired on the first frame.
- If you enter the Mega Satan room without defeating the Lamb first on the "Everything" race goal, something very bad will happen. (Thanks Shigan and BMZ_Loop)
- You can no longer use the Glowing Hour Glass in the pre-race room. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- If you have the Mysterious Paper trinket, you will now always have a choice between the two photos after defeating Mom. (It is impossible to tell if the player has the real Polaroid or Negative when this trinket is equipped.) (Thanks Molfried and Smoom)
- Fixed the bug where friendly enemies would prevent fast-clear from functioning. (Thanks thereisnofuture)
- Fixed the bug where The Compass was not being removed from all pools in seeded races.
- Fixed the bug where Rag Man Raglings would not work with fast-clear under certain conditions. (Thanks 910dan)
- Fixed the bug where the spike deleting code for the Depths/Necropolis bomb puzzle room was not being applied to the flipped versions of those rooms. (Thanks SlashSP)
- Fixed the bug where you could hear the beginning of the recharge sound every time you reset on Eden.
- Fixed the bug where the number of people ready was not properly updated in the pre-race room if someone left the race. (Thanks Nariom)

Client/Server:

- The server once again shows the [race listing](https://isaacracing.net/races). The page has been updated and looks much better than before. Sillypears programmed this, so a big thanks goes to him.
- The server once again shows [player profiles](https://isaacracing.net/profiles). This was also programmed by Sillypears.
- The server now requires that you have the latest version of the client before letting you connect.
- The client will now automatically logout if you logout of Steam in order to curb unscrupulous behavior.
- The client no longer checks to see if you have the Racing+ mod installed when you launch it. (Thanks Hyphen-ated)
- When creating a new race, the client now remembers all of the values that you entered in the last time the client was open. (Thanks Hyphen-ated)
- The client will now perform a more robust check to see if your mod is corrupted. If it detects your mod is corrupted, it will restart your game.
- Fixed the bug where the Chinese racer named "box" would mess up the lobby users list. (It wasn't his fault.)
- Fixed the bug where selecting a random character in the new race tooltip would not include Samael. (Thanks Shigan)
- Removed the "Ctrl+C" and "Ctrl+V" hotkeys since they are not needed anymore.
- Removed the double negative in the "Enable boss cutscenes" checkbox. (Thanks TeaLex)
- The client will now automatically remove all trailing slashes in your Twitch URL. (Thanks Thoday)
- The server now keeps track of when you enter all rooms and when you pick up all items.
- The server now keeps track of what item you started (in non-seeded races).

### *v0.9.5* - August 14th, 2017

- Mid-race placements will now work in races with over 10 people in them. (This was previously disabled to stop the server from crashing.)
- Fixed some placements of Mega Maws and Gates in flipped rooms on The Chest and The Dark Room. (Thanks Thalen22 and thereisnofuture)
- Fixed some miscellaneous bugs with the server. (Thanks PassionDrama and Molfried)

### *v0.9.0* - August 13th, 2017

- The server has been rewritten mostly from scratch in an attempt to fix the deadlocking issue that was causing it to crash every once in a while. This process took around 60 hours over the past week, with around 7500 new lines of code.
  - The new server should be an order of magnitude faster and will be able to support race ghosts in the same vein that Mario Kart has.
  - The [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html) database was replaced with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/about/). This was the thing holding leaderboards back. Now it should be pretty easy to make them.
  - The Golem WebSocket framework was replaced with the Melody WebSocket framework. Golem's handling of WebSockets was causing the deadlock during times of mass sending.
- Are you ready to get flipped? In order to promote run diversity, all rooms now have the possibility to be flipped on the X axis, the Y axis, or both axises.
  - This will only be noticeable in non-symmetrical rooms.
  - All room shapes are preserved with the exception of L rooms, which are flipped accordingly.
  - Since the probabilities of getting each individual room are the same (discounting entrances), there are no general strategical implications of this change.
    - One small exception is that instead of there being only 3 types of top-left L-rooms in The Chest, there are now 12.
    - Another small exception is that the trapdoor room on the Caves/Catacombs/Depths/Necropolis is flipped, so you can get it from the bottom now instead of only from the top.
  - An enormous thanks goes to Chronometrics for this, as he designed the custom code that allowed this to be programmatically done.
- The server will no longer send messages to your Twitch chat if your client is closed.
- In the client, the "Custom" character is now replaced with "Samael" and shows a graphic for him.
- Fixed the bug where mid-race placements were messed up on non-seeded races. (Thanks Shigan and BMZ_Loop)

### *v0.8.20* - August 3rd, 2017

- Fixed the bug where the Booster Pack #3 items were not in any item pools. (Thanks Flaw98)

### *v0.8.15* - August 3rd, 2017

- The client installer will now work on 32-bit systems. (Thanks missingyes)
- Fixed the bug where you could take both The Polaroid and The Negative if both spawned. (Thanks Krakenos and CrafterLynx)

### *v0.8.14* - August 3rd, 2017

- The seed will now be shown in the upper-left hand corner of the screen after finishing a race or finishing a run on a multi-character speedrun custom challenge. Now, players do not have to use Hyphen-ated's item tracker (or manually pause the game) in order to have their runs be legal on Speedrun.com. (Thanks Krakenos)
- The "Unseeded (Beginner)" format is renamed to "Unseeded (Lite)". (Thanks SlashSP)
- Isaac now starts with 1.6 speed (instead of 1.0 speed) in the "Change Char Order" custom challenge. This should making choosing your order a little less cumbersome. (Thanks Thoday)
- If you start with The Polaroid or The Negative in a diversity race, the opposite photo will now spawn after defeating Mom. If you start with both The Polaroid and The Negative, a random boss item will spawn. (Thanks tODDlife, Krakenos, and BMZ_Loop)
- Fixed the bug where the bomb puzzle room in Dank Depths would have invisible collision on squares where spikes were removed. Spikes will still be removed, but now they won't be replaced with rocks. (Thanks Karolmo)
- Fixed the bug where fast-clear would not work if a black worm was spawned from the My Shadow item. (Thanks BMZ_Loop)
- Fixed the bug where big 4 items could fart-reroll into other big 4 items in the "Unseeded (Lite)" format. (Thanks leo_ze_tron)
- Fixed the bug where fast-clear would not work with Hosts that were spawned as a Mushroom replacement. (Thanks Chronometrics)
- Fixed the bug where fast-clear would not work with Rag Man's Raglings. (Thanks BMZ_Loop)
- Fixed the bug where you could sometimes see The Polaroid or The Negative for a frame before it was moved or deleted.
- Fixed the bug where you could sometimes see the trapdoor on Womb 2 for a frame before it was moved or deleted. (Thanks BMZ_Loop)
- Fixed the bug where the trapdoor would spawn closed after Isaac and Blue Baby in the "Everything" race goal. (It will now spawn open like it does after Satan.)
- Fixed the bug where the beam of light that spawns after It Lives! would take a while to activate when reloading the room.

### *v0.8.13* - July 31st, 2017

- For the "Mega Satan" and "Everything" race goals, going into the Mega Satan room will count as a new floor for the purposes of updating the mid-race place indicator. (It will show as "MS" as your floor inside the client.)

- Fixed the bug where you could use a Sacrifice Room to cheat on the "Everything" race goal. (Thanks thereisnofuture)

### *v0.8.4* - July 28th, 2017

- When you have the Schoolbag but no 2nd active item, there will now be a faded placeholder graphic of a Schoolbag to indicate this. (Thanks thisguyisbarry)

### *v0.5.18* - April 20th, 2017

### *v0.4.16* - April 3rd, 2017

- Removed the April Fool's joke where [Big Horn and Little Horn had clown suits](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850578581), which is a mod from [Mr. Metal Alex](http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalAlex/myworkshopfiles/?appid=250900).

### *v0.4.9* - March 31st, 2017

- It is pretty unfair when a Mimic chest spawns behind you and your body is blocking the two spike tells. (Or, alternatively, if the Mimic is behind a dying enemy.) To rectify this problem, Mimic chests now have a custom "Appear" animation if they spawn within a certain distance of the player. If you want to see this in action, use the "spawn mimic" console command. If you get hit by a mimic chest and you feel that it wasn't your fault or that it was unfair, show me the clip and we can continue to work on it.  (Thanks Dea1h and TeaLex)
- Fixed the bug where the Butter! trinket wouldn't work properly with the Schoolbag. (Thanks MrNeedForSpeed96)
- Fixed the bug where trapdoors would be duplicated in rooms that weren't connected to the level grid under certain circumstances. (Thanks thereisnofuture)

- Replaced all of the Rules card text snippets with educational history.

### *v0.4.7* - March 30th, 2017

- You can now do a Schoolbag switch during the "use item" animation. This is a big buff to the item.
- Charge-bars are now minimalistic.
- Changed the Broken Modem sprite to one that isn't complete garbage. (I got it from freeze, the original author of the item.)

- Fixed the bug where trapdoors would disappear in certain circumstances.
- Fixed the bug where a rock could occupy the same square as a trapdoor or crawlspace under certain conditions. (Thanks CrafterLynx)
- Fixed the bug where the starting items for seeded and diversity races would not show up. (Thanks PassionDrama)
- Fixed the client bug where the question mark icon would not show up next to the build on the new race tooltip.

### *v0.4.5* - March 29th, 2017

- For races to Mega Satan and races that are already completed, the Mega Satan door will be automatically opened. (This is simpler than placing a Get Ouf of Jail Free Card next to the door.)
- Fast-travel no longer applies to the portal to the Blue Womb. This fixes the bug where the Blue Womb trapdoor would take you to Sheol instead of the Blue Womb. (Thanks Dea1h)
- Fixed the bug where Dr. Fetus bombs could be shot while jumping through the new trapdoors. (Thanks PassionDrama and TeaLex)
- The 13 luck for the Fire Mind build is now a custom item called "13 Luck". It should now function properly with other items. (Thanks thisguyisbarry)
- Reduced the delay for the beam of light in the Cathedral to 16 frames. (Thanks Dea1h)
- Made the fast-reset feature work for people who have reset bound to shift. (Thanks MasterofPotato)
- Fixed an unavoidable damage room in the Caves (#167). (Thanks Dea1h)

### *v0.4.3* - March 28th, 2017

- The hitbox on trapdoors and crawlspaces was slightly larger than it was on vanilla due to having to override the vanilla entities. Racing+ now uses custom entities for these, which fixes the bug where you would sometimes accidentally walk into a trapdoor while entering a Devil Room, for example. This also fixes the bug where you would sometimes skip a floor when going in a trapdoor.
- Fixed the bug where your blue flies / spiders would kill themselves on the custom floor transition hole. (Thanks CrafterLynx)
- Fixed the crash when a diversity race started with Booster Pack #1 items. (Thanks stoogebag)

### *v0.4.0* - March 27th, 2017

- When starting a new run, Racing+ will now automatically put on the "Total Curse Immunity" Easter Egg for you (the "BLCK CNDL" seed). If Basement 1 happened to have a curse on it, the run will be automatically restarted. [Rejoice, and be merry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHvnxbtHqsE).
- The racing system was rewritten such that you should never have to go back to the menu in between races anymore (unless you need to change your character). You will now start the race in an isolated room, and all races will start by resetting the game.
- Seeded races will automatically start you on the correct seed; you do not have to type it in anymore.
- Pressing the reset key will now instantly reset the game. (This change is experimental.)
- The client now validates that you are not on a challenge before letting you ready up.
- The mod now has some new pre-race graphics, including showing you the goal. (Thanks stoogebag)
- The long and annoying fade out / fade in animation between floors has been replaced with something better. (Thanks PassionDrama for helping to test.)
- The Schoolbag will now work properly with the new Booster Pack items. (Thanks meepmeep)
- Diversity races that start with the new Booster Pack items will now work properly. (Thanks BMZ_Loop)
- Fixed the unavoidable damage when Spiked Chests or Mimics spawn in Caves/Catacombs room #19. (Thanks PassionDrama)
- In diversity races, when you pick up Crown of Light from a Basement 1 Treasure Room, it will now heal you for half a heart if you are not already at full red hearts. (Thanks Dea1h)
- Fixed the bug where banned items would roll into other banned items under certain conditions. (Thanks Lobsterosity)
- If Eden starts with Book of Sin, Crystal Ball, Betrayal, or Smelter, they will now start with the Racing+ custom version of the item.

### *v0.3.2* - March 23rd, 2017

### *v0.2.85* - March 21st, 2017

- It seems to be pretty common for the Steam download system to break people's mods whenever I push an update. Now, whenever you log in with the client, if you have a damaged mod, it will automatically be healed.
- Fixed the bug where you could recharge your active item by swapping for another active item. (Thanks dion)
- Fixed the bug where items that were not fully decremented on sight rolled into themselves. This involved rewriting both the item ban system and the RNG that the mod uses. The ban system now seeds items one by one starting with the room seed. The RNG is now based on the game's internal RNG. (Thanks Rex and Krakenos, and thanks blcd for ShiftIdx recommendation)
- Fixed the bug where rerolled items would be swapped if one item was purchased beforehand and the other one wasn't.
- Fixed the bug where Schoolbag items were not added to the ban list on seeded races. (Thanks Cyber_1)

- Fixed the bug with the Schoolbag where the game would play a sound when you switched to an item that was not fully charged.
- Fixed the bug where teleporting would cause you to lose your Schoolbag item under certain circumstances. (Thanks Dea1h)

- Fixed the bug where some glowing item and trinket images were not showing up properly on the starting room. (Thanks Krakenos)
- Fixed the bug where starting the Boss Rush would not grant a charge to the Schoolbag item. Note that actually clearing the Boss Rush still won't give any charges, due to limitations with the Afterbirth+ API. (Thanks Dea1h)
- Fixed the bug where fart-reroll items would start at 0 charges. (Thanks Munch)
- The Polaroid and The Negative are no longer automatically removed in the Pageant Boy ruleset.
- The beam of light and the trapdoor are no longer automatically removed after It Lives! in the Pageant Boy ruleset.

- Items shown on the starting room in seeded and diversity races now have a glow so that it is easier to see them. (The glow images were taken from the item tracker.)

### *v0.2.73* - March 17th, 2017

- The Racing+ versions of The Book of Sin, Crystal Ball, Smelter, and Betrayal now work with the item tracker. If you haven't already, make sure that you download the latest version of the tracker. (The item tracker will now also auto-update if you have v2.0 or higher.) Thanks goes to Hyphen-ated for this.
- The Racing+ custom items Schoolbag, Soul Jar, Victory Lap, Off Limits, and Debug will now work with the item tracker. Thanks also goes to Gromfalloon for the artwork on the Soul Jar icon.

- A Get out of Jail Free Card will now spawn next to the Mega Satan door if you visit the starting room after finishing a race.
- The Forget Me Now that spawns after a race has been replaced with a custom item called Victory Lap. Victory Lap is a passive item, so you don't have to give up your active items anymore to reset the floor.
- Added a feature where Blue Baby will be replaced on a Victory Lap with 2+ random bosses. The number of bosses will continue to increase with the amount of total victory laps that you have done.
- Fixed the bug where Keeper would lose a coin container under certain conditions. (Thanks Cyber_1)
- Fixed the bug where Krampus' head would turn into A Lump of Coal under certain conditions. (Thanks Cyber_1)

### *v0.2.72* - March 17th, 2017

- Boomerang, Butter Bean, The Candle, Red Candle, Glass Cannon, Brown Nugget, and Sharp Straw all appear properly now in the Schoolbag. (Thanks Birdie)
- The bug where the aforementioned items would not start fully charged is also fixed.
- Fixed a client crash when diversity races started with certain items. (No-one actually reported this out of the 12 people that it happened to. WutFace)
- Fixed the (vanilla) unavoidable damage when a Mimic spawns on top of you. (Thanks henry_92)
- All Spike Chests will now spawn as Mimics instead, since there isn't really a point in having both of them. (Thanks thisguyisbarry)
- Mimics are ridiculously trivial to spot, so their graphics have been experimentally reverted back to the pre-nerf graphics. You can tell them apart from normal chests by just looking for the beginnings of the spikes protruding from them. It's fairly easy to see if you just pay attention and look for it. It can be very rewarding when you are paying attention and it pays off: https://clips.twitch.tv/AssiduousSillyLardTwitchRPG
- Fixed the unavoidable damage that occurs when Spiked Chests and Mimics spawn in very specific rooms that only have a narrow path surrounded by walls or pits (Caves #12, Caves #244, Caves/Catacombs #518, Caves #519, Womb/Utero #489). In these rooms, all Spiked Chests / Mimics will be converted to normal chests. If you find more rooms with narrow paths like these ones, let me know.

### *v0.2.71* - March 16th, 2017
