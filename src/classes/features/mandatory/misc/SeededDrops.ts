   * Normally, room drops are based on the room's seed. This is undesirable, since someone can go a
   * wrong way in a seeded race and then get rewarded with an Emperor card that the other player
   * does not get.
   *
   * Thus, we overwrite the game's room drop system with one that manually spawns awards in order.
   * The following code is based on the game's internal logic, documented here, which was reverse
   * engineered by Blade:
   *
   * https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Room_Clear_Awards
   *
   * However, we implement this algorithm differently from vanilla.
   *
   * First, we hard-code values of 0 luck so that room drops are completely consistent. (Otherwise,
   * one player would be able to get a lucky Emperor card by using a Luck Up or Luck Down pill, for
   * example.)
   *
   * Second, we ignore the following items, since we remove them from pools:
   *
   * - Daemon's Tail (22)
   * - Child's Heart (34)
   * - Rusted Key (36)
   * - Match Stick (41)
   * - Lucky Toe (42)
   * - Safety Cap (44)
   * - Ace of Spades (45)
   * - Lucky Foot (46)
   * - Watch Battery (72)
   * - Silver Dollar (110)
   * - Bloody Crown (111)
   * - Nuh Uh! (165)
   *
   * Old Capacitor (143) does not need to be removed, since the Lil Battery chance is independent of
   * the room drop.
