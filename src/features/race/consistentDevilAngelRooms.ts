// In seeded races, players will get either all Devil Rooms or all Angel Rooms, with a certain
// chance of each based on the starting seed of the run. This is accomplished by using the
// `Level.InitializeDevilAngelRoom` method to pre-initialize the room at the beginning of the floor.

// The one bug to worry about is when one player has 33.8% + 33.8% versus 67.8% + 0% chances, for
// Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms respectively. In this situation, one player can get a deal while the
// other can't. To work around this, we always use the `Game.AddDevilRoomDeal` method at the
// beginning of a run to ensure that the Angel Room chance for players remains at 0. This works even
// for the situation where the run is locked into having Angel Rooms, although the UI will report
// the wrong percentages.
